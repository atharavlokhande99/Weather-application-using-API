#DECRIPTION---The Weather App described in the code snippet is a simple yet effective web-based application that allows users to check the current weather in any location. By using an external API, the app fetches real-time weather data and presents it in a clear, easy-to-read interface. The app is divided into three key parts: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, each responsible for a specific aspect of the appâ€™s functionality and appearance.The HTML portion defines the overall structure of the app and provides the necessary elements that allow users to interact with the application. Within the HTML, several key components are used. The <h1>tag displays the main title "Weather App,"clearly indicating the purpose of the page.
